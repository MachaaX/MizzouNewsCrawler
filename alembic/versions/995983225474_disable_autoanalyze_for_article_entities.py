    """Disable autovacuum ANALYZE for article_entities.
    
    The article_entities table is write-once, read-many:
    - Written only during bulk entity extraction for new sources
    - Read constantly by NER queries and analytics
    
    Auto-analyze wastes resources checking this table daily when it rarely changes.
    Instead, we manually run ANALYZE after bulk entity insertion via:
      session.execute(text('ANALYZE article_entities'))
    
    This ensures new entities are indexed immediately when added, without
    unnecessary daily overhead for a mostly-static table.
    
    Note: We keep autovacuum enabled for cleanup, just disable auto-analyze.
