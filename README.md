[![CI](https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler-Scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler-Scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A production news crawler system deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Kubernetes orchestration.

## Overview

MizzouNewsCrawler is a cloud-native news discovery and processing pipeline that automatically discovers, extracts, and analyzes local news articles. The system runs on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with managed PostgreSQL, Argo Workflows orchestration, and containerized microservices.

**Production Architecture:**

- **Deployment**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster `mizzou-cluster` in `us-central1-a`

- **Database**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (`mizzou-db-prod`) with Cloud SQL Connector

- **Orchestration**: Argo Workflows with CronWorkflow scheduling for pipeline automation

- **Container Registry**: Artifact Registry (`us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mizzou-news-crawler`)

- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build triggers for automated containerized deployments

- **Local Development**: SQLite backend with Docker Compose support

## System Architecture

### Production Deployment (GCP/Kubernetes)

**Infrastructure:**

- **GKE Cluster**: `mizzou-cluster` in `us-central1-a` zone

- **Database**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance `mizzou-db-prod`

- **Connection Pattern**: Cloud SQL Connector (no proxy sidecar required)

- **Workload Identity**: Service account `mizzou-app` with IAM permissions

- **Priority Classes**: `service-critical` (API), `service-standard` (processor), `batch-low` (jobs)

**Deployed Services:**

- **API Service** (`mizzou-api`): FastAPI backend with telemetry and admin endpoints (1 replica, LoadBalancer)

- **Processor Service** (`mizzou-processor`): Continuous processor for cleaning, ML analysis, entity extraction (1 replica)

- **Argo Workflows**: Pipeline orchestration with `mizzou-news-pipeline` CronWorkflow (runs every 6 hours)

**Pipeline Components:**

1. **Discovery**: Argo workflow discovers article URLs from RSS feeds and sitemaps

1. **Verification**: Argo workflow validates URLs with StorySniffer

1. **Extraction**: Argo workflow fetches and extracts article content

1. **Cleaning**: Processor removes boilerplate and cleans content

1. **ML Classification**: Processor applies Critical Information Needs (CIN) classification

1. **Entity Extraction**: Processor extracts geographic entities and locations

### Data Flow

## Getting Started

License

This project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0-or-later). See the `LICENSE` file for full text and `DEP_LICENSES.md` for a dependency license report.


### Prerequisites

**For Local Development:**

- Python 3.11 or newer (the codebase targets modern typing features, numpy 2.x, and Torch 2.x)

- `pip` and `virtualenv` tooling

- SQLite 3 (bundled with Python) or PostgreSQL 16+

- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized local development

- Optional: Node.js 18+ if you want to run the markdown lint workflow under `npm`

**For Production Deployment:**

- Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled

- `gcloud` CLI configured with appropriate permissions

- `kubectl` for Kubernetes management

- Access to the `mizzou-news-crawler` GCP project

### Installation

**Local Development Setup:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler.git
cd MizzouNewsCrawler

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install development tools (linting, testing)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended for contributors)
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

**Docker-based Development (Alternative):**

```bash
# Start local development stack with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# This starts:
# - PostgreSQL database (local)
# - API service (port 8000)
# - Frontend (if configured)
```

**Environment Configuration:**

Copy the example environment file and configure for your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

For local development, SQLite is used by default. To use PostgreSQL locally, set:

```bash
DATABASE_ENGINE=postgresql+psycopg2
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=mizzou_dev
# ... other database settings
```

### First Run Checklist

1. **Set up pre-deployment validation** (prevents deployment bugs):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
   ```

   This installs a pre-push hook that validates your changes before pushing.

1. Seed the SQLite database with crawler sources:

   ```bash
   python -m src.cli load-sources --csv sources/publinks.csv
   ```

1. Discover a small batch of URLs to confirm the pipeline wiring:

   ```bash
   python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-limit 10 --dry-run
   ```

1. Extract content and inspect the new telemetry-rich content cleaner output:

  ```bash
  python -m src.cli content-cleaning analyze-domains \
    --domain example.com \
    --dry-run \
    --verbose
  ```

1. When you're ready to persist cleaning results, rerun without `--dry-run`. The CLI now truncates article IDs in logs, records timing metadata, and writes removal details back into telemetry tables for downstream ML jobs.

### Manual enqueue batches

Use `scripts/manual_enqueue_urls.py` when you need to seed specific URLs directly into `candidate_links` without running discovery. Every upload is now tied to a dataset so the records remain traceable through verification, extraction, and analytics.

1. Populate the template at `reports/manual_enqueue_template.csv`. Leave the `dataset_id` column blank unless you want to attach the batch to an existing dataset UUID—the script will create a new dataset automatically and print its ID/slug after the insert runs.

1. Run the script from the project root:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python scripts/manual_enqueue_urls.py \
     --input reports/manual_enqueue_template.csv \
     --discovered-by "community-tip" \
     --priority 7 \
     --dataset-label "Community Tip Sheet Sept 2025"
   ```

   Use `--dataset-id` to reuse an existing dataset and `--dry-run` to preview the rows without touching the database.

1. Check the console output for the generated dataset ID. The same identifier is written onto each new `candidate_links` row so you can filter processing telemetry or backfills by batch later.

By default the script connects to the repository SQLite database. In tests you can monkeypatch `DatabaseManager` or set up a scratch database to keep local experiments isolated.

### Format requirements for `sources/publinks.csv`

The `load-sources` command expects a UTF-8 CSV whose headers match the schema below. Every row represents a single publication that the crawler can target.

| Column | Required | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host_id` | ✅ | Stable identifier from the original dataset. Kept as a string so that legacy numeric IDs survive round-trips. | `163` |
| `name` | ✅ | Display name of the outlet. Stored as `Source.canonical_name` and pushed into telemetry dashboards. | `Sikeston Standard Democrat` |
| `city` | ✅ | Primary city for coverage and reporting. Used when summarizing dataset stats. | `Sikeston` |
| `county` | ✅ | County (no "County" suffix needed). Powers geographic filters and CIN analytics. | `Scott` |
| `url_news` | ✅ | An HTTPS article URL or homepage for the outlet. The loader normalizes the host and seeds the initial `candidate_links` table from it. | `https://standard-democrat.com/story/2977919.html` |

The following fields are optional but strongly recommended because downstream jobs read them from `Source.meta` or the `candidate_links` table:

- `frequency` – Free-text publishing cadence (`daily`, `weekly`, `bi-weekly`, etc.). Defaults to `unknown` when omitted.

- `media_type` – One of `print native`, `digital_native`, `audio_broadcast`, `video_broadcast`, or other descriptive tags. The geo filter uses this to tune heuristics (broadcast outlets often contribute fewer URLs).

- `address1` / `address2`, `State`, `zip` – Mailing address metadata. The loader converts `zip` values to strings and stores them for gazetteer enrichment. Two-letter state abbreviations keep the downstream map clean.

- `owner` – Parent company or individual owner.

- `source` – Provenance tag (e.g., `research`, `UNC`, `media cloud`) that helps track how the record entered the dataset.

Cached entity columns capture precomputed coverage areas for the publication. Keep values pipe-delimited (`|`) with plain-text names; the strings are stored verbatim and later reused by the geography-aware filters:

- `cached_geographic_entities`

- `cached_institutions`

- `cached_schools`

- `cached_government`

- `cached_healthcare`

- `cached_businesses`

- `cached_landmarks`

Rows missing any required field are skipped, and duplicate `url_news` hosts collapse into existing `Source` records. When preparing new data drops, validate the header row and run `python -m src.cli load-sources --csv <path>` from a virtual environment to confirm the importer accepts your file.

## Pipeline Orchestration (Refactored)

**New in Issue #77**: The pipeline orchestration has been refactored to separate external site interaction (discovery/extraction) from internal processing (cleaning/ML/entities).

### Architecture

The pipeline is now split into two components:

1. **Dataset-Specific Jobs** - Handle discovery and extraction per dataset with independent rate limiting

1. **Continuous Processor** - Handles cleaning, ML analysis, and entity extraction for all datasets

This architecture provides:

- Independent rate limiting per dataset (e.g., Lehigh 90-180s, Mizzou 5-15s)

- Isolated CAPTCHA backoff (blocks on one dataset don't affect others)

- Better monitoring and fault isolation

- Easy scaling by adding new dataset jobs

### Running Dataset Jobs

```bash
# Discovery job (find new URLs)
kubectl apply -f k8s/mizzou-discovery-job.yaml

# Extraction job (fetch and extract content)
kubectl apply -f k8s/mizzou-extraction-job.yaml

# Monitor progress
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=Mizzou --follow
```

### Continuous Processor

The continuous processor now focuses only on internal processing steps:

```yaml
env:

  - name: ENABLE_DISCOVERY
    value: "false"  # Moved to dataset jobs

  - name: ENABLE_EXTRACTION
    value: "false"  # Moved to dataset jobs

  - name: ENABLE_CLEANING
    value: "true"   # Remains in processor

  - name: ENABLE_ML_ANALYSIS
    value: "true"   # Remains in processor

  - name: ENABLE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION
    value: "true"   # Remains in processor
```

## Recent Maintenance (2025-09-27)

### Obituary and opinion detection

- The extraction pipeline now tags obituary and opinion pieces during the
  initial ingest step. Articles matching the new heuristics are stored with
  `status` values of `obituary` or `opinion`, and their detection metadata is
  preserved in `articles.metadata.content_type_detection` for review.

- Tagging these content types ensures they bypass entity extraction and ML
  classification. Downstream services ignore the new statuses without any
  additional configuration.

- Telemetry gains a `content_type_detection_telemetry` table (queried via
  `ComprehensiveExtractionTelemetry.get_content_type_detections`) so reviewers
  can audit heuristics and export high-signal samples for future model
  training.

## Recent Maintenance (2025-09-26)

### Content cleaning telemetry refresh

- `BalancedBoundaryContentCleaner.process_single_article` now returns rich `removal_details`, a `share_header_removed_text` payload, and honors `dry_run` so exploratory runs never mutate the database.

- Social-share headers are detected as a first-class pattern with telemetry logging, giving the CLI immediate insight into what was stripped before persisting updates.

- Telemetry sessions capture the full wire-detection story (including local byline overrides), allowing analytics jobs to distinguish suppressed wire content from genuine local stories.

### CLI content-cleaning commands

- Introduced a `_clean_with_balanced` helper in `src/cli/commands/content_cleaning.py` so every subcommand (`analyze-domains`, `apply-cleaning`, `clean-article`, and the new `clean-content`) shares the same telemetry wiring, dry-run guard, and segment metadata.

- Verbose output is now wrapped to within 79 columns and includes truncated article IDs, pattern classifications, and per-segment confidence/position data for easier triage.

- CLI dry runs mirror production writes: the helper collects processing time, character deltas, and removal payloads even when no database commit occurs.

## Recent Maintenance (2025-09-24)

### Telemetry alignment

- Confirmed that the gazetteer enrichment telemetry is still emitting the full four-event sequence (attempt → geocoding → OSM query → enrichment result). You can tail `gazetteer_telemetry.log` in the repo root to verify the JSON payloads or run a focused dry run with `python scripts/populate_gazetteer.py --address "Columbia, MO" --dry-run` to generate fresh events without mutating the database.

- Verified that `scripts/monitor_gazetteer.py` surfaces the `query_groups_used` counter so the slimmer grouped-query footprint remains visible in console summaries.

- The telemetry JSON continues to play nicely with pytest captures; if you need to confirm structure, `python -m pytest tests/test_telemetry_system.py -k gazetteer -vv` validates the schema the log writer emits.

### Metadata & cleaning fixes

- Normalized `articles.metadata` so that legacy single-quoted Python dict strings are re-serialized as valid JSON. This prevents downstream JSON extraction failures and allowed the classification pipeline to hydrate publication context again. The one-off cleanup snippet we ran is preserved below for future backfills:

  ```python
  import json
  import sqlite3
  from ast import literal_eval

  with sqlite3.connect("data/mizzou.db") as conn:
    rows = conn.execute(
      "SELECT id, metadata FROM articles WHERE metadata LIKE '{%'"
    ).fetchall()
    for article_id, raw in rows:
      try:
        normalized = json.dumps(literal_eval(raw))
      except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
        continue
      conn.execute(
        "UPDATE articles SET metadata = ? WHERE id = ?",
        (normalized, article_id),
      )
    conn.commit()
  ```

- After normalizing metadata, rerun the `clean_authors.py` smoke checks to ensure the Gazetteer-driven organization filters still match publication names pulled from metadata.

- Spot-check content-cleaning telemetry with `python detailed_content_analysis.py --domain example.com` to confirm that newly captured segments continue to hydrate the `content_cleaning_telemetry` tables without JSON parsing errors.

### CIN classifier rollout

- `models/productionmodel.pt` is now the default CIN checkpoint used by the CLI `analyze` command. The loader in `src/ml/article_classifier.py` remaps legacy `classifier_primary.*` keys so the model initializes cleanly on CPU. Expect an informational log confirming the resolved checkpoint path when the model loads.

- To refresh the label store after the checkpoint swap, we executed:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  python -m src.cli analyze \
    --model-path models/productionmodel.pt \
    --label-version cin-2024q4 \
    --statuses cleaned local \
    --batch-size 32
  ```

  The first pass reprocessed the 50 provisional articles; a second run without `--limit` cleared the remaining 2,341 eligible records.

- The latest classification export lives in `reports/cin_labels_last14days_with_sources.csv`. It excludes wire stories, joins publication name/city/county metadata, and is written with UTF-8 encoding for compatibility with downstream analytics notebooks.

- When adding new CIN labels, continue filtering on `articles.source_is_wire = 0` and persist the joined dataset via pandas’ `to_csv(..., encoding="utf-8", index=False)` to match the sanitized export format.

## LLM summarization pipeline

### Why we summarize articles

- **Editorial context**: Each run yields a few sentences that restate the article’s subject, the main action, plus the provider metadata saved in `Article.meta["llm"].summary`. The pipeline does not emit CIN predictions or other structured outputs on its own.

- **Metadata smoke test**: The prompt template composes each request from the article title, author/byline, publish date, URL, and cleaned body text. If any of those fields are missing, the summary run highlights the gap (`unknown` placeholders surface immediately), making this an ideal checkpoint for validating DOM extraction rules.

- **Model comparison**: Because the summarisation run captures the same article metadata used by the CIN classifier, you can compare LLM-derived interpretations with the classifier’s Critical Information Needs output or the predictions from other providers when you need a sanity check.

### Configuration

Populate the relevant environment variables (see `.env.example` for a full list):

- `LLM_PROVIDER_SEQUENCE`: Comma-separated provider slugs in fallback order (default: `openai-gpt4.1,openai-gpt4.1-mini,claude-3.5-sonnet,gemini-1.5-flash`).

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION`: Credentials for GPT‑4.1 models.

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Enables Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Enables Gemini 1.5 Flash.

- `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `LLM_MAX_RETRIES`, `LLM_DEFAULT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `LLM_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`: Optional overrides for orchestration behavior.

- `VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER` (plus provider-specific keys like `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `WEAVIATE_URL`, etc.): Turns on embedding/vector storage when available; the factory falls back to a no-op when unset.

### CLI usage

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m src.cli llm status

# Generate summaries for the most recent "cleaned" articles without committing results
python -m src.cli llm run --statuses cleaned local --limit 10 --dry-run --show-failures

# Persist summaries for everything in "cleaned" status (omit --dry-run)
python -m src.cli llm run --statuses cleaned local --limit 50
```

- `llm status` prints the active provider order, which API keys are configured, and any vector-store integration that will be used.

- `llm run` orchestrates the provider sequence, writing summary metadata (or failure details) back to each article. Use `--dry-run` while tuning selectors and `--show-failures` to inspect per-provider errors.

- `--prompt-template` accepts a custom prompt file if you need domain-specific instructions for QA runs.

### Suggested QA workflow

1. Run your usual discovery/extraction path to populate `Article` rows with CIN predictions and cleaned content.

1. Execute `python -m src.cli llm run --statuses cleaned --limit 20 --dry-run --show-failures` to exercise the prompt template without committing results.

1. Inspect the console output (or the `Article.meta["llm"]` payload when not in dry-run mode) and confirm that the title/byline/publish date fields look correct, the summary echoes the Critical Information Needs classification already applied by the CIN model, and provider failures (if any) call out missing credentials or rate limits before you scale up batches.

## Architecture

**CSV-to-Database-Driven Design:**

1. Load `publinks.csv` into SQLite database (one-time setup)

1. All crawler operations are driven from database queries

1. Support filtering by ALL/HOST/COUNTY/CITY with configurable limits

1. Database tracks crawling progress and status

### Architectural Patterns & Solutions

**API Optimization Strategy:**

- **Grouped Query Pattern**: Logical grouping of related API calls to reduce total requests while maintaining comprehensive coverage

- **Rate Limiting & Backoff**: Respectful API usage with configurable delays and retry mechanisms

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when complex queries fail, with automatic fallback to individual calls

**Geographic Data Integration:**

- **OpenStreetMap Integration**: Comprehensive geographic entity discovery using OSM Overpass API

- **Intelligent Categorization**: 11-category system covering civic, commercial, recreational, and cultural entities

- **Query Optimization**: 67% API call reduction through smart filter grouping and wildcard replacement

**Error Handling & Resilience:**

- **Robust Query Processing**: Automatic handling of problematic OSM filters (e.g., `historic=*` wildcards)

- **Element Distribution Logic**: Accurate categorization of geographic entities based on OSM tags

- **Debug Instrumentation**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis

**Scalability Patterns:**

- **Database-Driven Operations**: All crawler activities driven by database state, enabling distributed processing

- **Modular Component Design**: Separated concerns for crawling, content extraction, geographic processing, and data storage

- **Background Processing**: Automatic gazetteer population triggered by data loading events

## Gazetteer Telemetry System

The project includes a comprehensive telemetry system for monitoring gazetteer population processes, providing detailed insights into geographic data processing, API usage, and system performance.

### Telemetry Architecture

**GazetteerTelemetry Class:**

- **Structured JSON Logging**: All telemetry events recorded as structured JSON for easy parsing and analysis

- **Multi-Event Tracking**: Four distinct event types covering the complete gazetteer enrichment pipeline

- **Dual Output Support**: Configurable file and console logging for development and production environments

- **pytest Integration**: Proper logging configuration enables test capture with `caplog` for development workflow

### Telemetry Event Types

{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T17:39:31.383301",
  "event": "enrichment_attempt",
  "source_id": "source-uuid-123",
  "source_name": "Example News Source",
  "location_data": {
    "city": "Columbia",
    "county": "Boone County",
    "state": "MO"
  }
}
```

**2. Geocoding Result (`geocoding_result`)**

```

### Geocoding Precision Levels

**Three-Tier Fallback System:**

1. **street_address**: Full address geocoding (most precise)

1. **city_county**: City + county + state fallback when address fails

1. **zip_code**: ZIP code-only geocoding (least precise, maximum coverage)

### Production Usage

**Telemetry Log File**: `gazetteer_telemetry.log` (structured JSON, one event per line)

**Running with Telemetry:**

```bash
# Production gazetteer population with full telemetry
python scripts/backfill_gazetteer_slow.py

# Single source telemetry testing
python scripts/populate_gazetteer.py --address "Columbia, MO" --dry-run

## Comprehensive Extraction Telemetry & Dashboard System

The project includes a comprehensive telemetry system for monitoring content extraction performance, HTTP errors, and site health, providing real-time insights for automated site management and React dashboard integration.

### Extraction Telemetry Architecture

**ExtractionMetrics Class:**

- **Method-Level Tracking**: Detailed timing and success tracking for each extraction method (newspaper4k, beautifulsoup, fallback)

- **HTTP Status Monitoring**: Automatic capture of HTTP status codes and error categorization (4xx_client_error, 5xx_server_error)

- **Field-Level Success**: Granular tracking of title, content, author, and date extraction success rates

- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Regex-based extraction of HTTP status codes from newspaper4k error messages

**ComprehensiveExtractionTelemetry Database:**

- **extraction_telemetry_v2**: Detailed extraction records with method timings, field success, and HTTP metrics

- **http_error_summary**: Aggregated HTTP error tracking by host and status code

- **Real-Time Aggregation**: Automatic rollup of error counts and performance statistics

### FastAPI Dashboard API Endpoints

**Telemetry Data Endpoints:**

```bash
# Overall extraction statistics and performance summary
GET /api/telemetry/summary?days=7

# HTTP error breakdown by host, status code, and time period
GET /api/telemetry/http-errors?days=7&host=example.com&status_code=403

# Extraction method performance analysis
GET /api/telemetry/method-performance?days=7

# Publisher-specific statistics and health metrics
GET /api/telemetry/publisher-stats?days=7&min_attempts=5

# Poor performing sites requiring attention
GET /api/telemetry/poor-performers?days=7&min_attempts=10&max_success_rate=25

# Field-level extraction success rates by method
GET /api/telemetry/field-extraction?days=7
```

**Site Management API:**

```bash
# Pause problematic sites based on performance thresholds
POST /api/site-management/pause
{
  "host": "problematic-site.com",
  "reason": "Poor performance: 0% success rate with 15 attempts"
}

# Resume paused sites after manual review
POST /api/site-management/resume
{
  "host": "fixed-site.com"
}

# List all currently paused sites
GET /api/site-management/paused

# Check individual site status
GET /api/site-management/status/example.com
```

### HTTP Error Detection & Tracking

**Automatic HTTP Status Extraction:**

- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Extracts HTTP status codes from newspaper4k error messages using pattern `Status code (\d+)`

- **Error Type Categorization**: Automatically categorizes errors as 3xx_redirect, 4xx_client_error, or 5xx_server_error

- **Publisher Error Aggregation**: Tracks error counts per host with first_seen and last_seen timestamps

**Error Tracking Examples:**

```python
# Error message: "Article `download()` failed with Status code 403"
# → Extracted: HTTP 403, Type: 4xx_client_error

# Error message: "HTTP Error: Status code 500 Internal Server Error"
# → Extracted: HTTP 500, Type: 5xx_server_error

# Automatic site management recommendation based on error patterns
# → Sites with >80% error rates flagged for pause recommendation
```

### Dashboard Integration Features

**Real-Time Performance Monitoring:**

- **Success Rate Tracking**: Publisher-level success rates with configurable thresholds

- **Method Effectiveness**: Comparative performance of extraction methods across publishers

- **HTTP Error Patterns**: Identification of systematic HTTP error patterns by host

kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# View API service
kubectl get service mizzou-api -n production
```

## CLI Usage

The project provides a comprehensive command-line interface through `python -m src.cli` (with `python -m src.cli.main` retained for backward compatibility) with the following commands:

### Core Workflow Commands

#### Load Sources (One-time Setup)

```bash
# Load publinks.csv into database
python -m src.cli load-sources --csv sources/publinks.csv

# Load with specific dataset label
python -m src.cli load-sources --csv sources/publinks.csv --dataset "publinks-2025-09"
```

#### URL Discovery

Discover article URLs using newspaper4k and RSS feeds with intelligent scheduling:

```bash
# Discover URLs for sources due for collection (default behavior)
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-limit 50

# Force discovery for all sources (ignore publication frequency)
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-limit 10 --force-all

# Discover for specific source
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-uuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc

# Discover with custom article limits and time range
python -m src.cli discover-urls --max-articles 100 --days-back 14 --source-limit 25

# Filter sources by name/URL pattern
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-filter "missouri" --source-limit 20

# Target a single host (exact match on candidate host)
python -m src.cli discover-urls --host "standard-democrat.com" --max-articles 40

# Filter by location metadata
python -m src.cli discover-urls --county "St. Louis" --city "Ferguson" --host-limit 5

# Skip saturated sources that already have enough extracted articles
python -m src.cli discover-urls --existing-article-limit 75 --source-limit 30
```

**Key Options:**

- `--due-only`: Only process sources due for discovery (enabled by default)

- `--force-all`: Override scheduling and process all sources (disables `--due-only`)

- `--max-articles`: Articles to discover per source (default: 50); legacy alias `--article-limit`

- `--existing-article-limit`: Skip sources that already have at least this many extracted articles (also set when using `--article-limit`)

- `--source-filter` / `--source`: Match sources by name or URL substring

- `--host`, `--city`, `--county`: Filter sources by metadata fields from `publinks`

- `--host-limit`: Cap the number of unique hosts processed in one run

- `--days-back`: How far back to look for articles (default: 7 days)

#### Content Extraction

Extract article content from discovered URLs:

```bash
# Extract content from articles (default: 10 articles, 1 batch)
python -m src.cli extract

# Extract larger batches
python -m src.cli extract --limit 50 --batches 5

# Extract from specific source only
python -m src.cli extract --source "Columbia Missourian" --limit 25

# Extract for specific dataset
python -m src.cli extract --dataset "custom-project-2025" --limit 20 --batches 10
```

#### Dataset-Specific Job Orchestration (Kubernetes)

Launch isolated extraction jobs for custom datasets in Kubernetes for better resource management and failure isolation:

```bash
# Launch extraction job for a dataset (dry-run to preview)
python scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
    --dataset custom-project-2025 \
    --batches 60 \
    --limit 20 \
    --dry-run

# Launch the actual job
python scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
    --dataset custom-project-2025 \
    --batches 60

# Launch with custom resource limits for large datasets
python scripts/launch_dataset_job.py \
    --dataset large-dataset \
    --batches 100 \
    --cpu-request 500m \
    --memory-request 2Gi \
    --memory-limit 4Gi

# Monitor job logs
kubectl logs -n production -l dataset=custom-project-2025 --follow

# Check job status
kubectl get job extract-custom-project-2025 -n production
```

**Benefits:**

- Isolated pod per dataset (failures don't affect other jobs)

- Independent logging with dataset labels

- Custom resource limits per dataset

- Automatic cleanup after 24 hours

- Parallel processing of multiple datasets

See [CUSTOM_SOURCELIST_README.md](CUSTOM_SOURCELIST_README.md) for complete workflow documentation.

### Deprecated Crawl Alias

The legacy `crawl` command now emits a deprecation warning and forwards all
arguments to `discover-urls`. Prefer running `discover-urls` directly so you get
access to the richer filtering options above. Example translation:

- Legacy: `python -m src.cli crawl --filter HOST --host standard-democrat.com --article-limit 10`

- Modern: `python -m src.cli discover-urls --host standard-democrat.com --article-limit 10`

All existing automation that still invokes `crawl` will continue to work, but
please plan to migrate scripts to `discover-urls` to avoid the warning and stay
on the supported path.

### Geographic Enhancement

#### Populate Gazetteer

Populate gazetteer table with geographic entities near publisher locations:

```bash
# Populate gazetteer for all datasets
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer

# Populate gazetteer for specific dataset
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --dataset "publinks-2025-09"

# Test with specific address
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --address "Columbia, MO" --radius 25

# Dry run (no database writes)
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --dry-run --address "Columbia, MO"
```

### Monitoring and Analysis

#### Status and Process Monitoring

```bash
# Show crawling statistics
python -m src.cli status

# Show background processes
python -m src.cli status --processes

# Show detailed status for specific process
python -m src.cli status --process abc123

# Show active background processes queue
python -m src.cli queue
```

#### Discovery Reporting

Generate detailed reports on URL discovery outcomes:

```bash
# Generate summary discovery report (last 24 hours)
python -m src.cli discovery-report

# Generate detailed report for last 48 hours
python -m src.cli discovery-report --hours-back 48 --format detailed

# Report for specific operation
python -m src.cli discovery-report --operation-id abc123 --format json

# Export report in JSON format
python -m src.cli discovery-report --format json --hours-back 72
```

#### Source Management

```bash
# List all sources with UUIDs and details
python -m src.cli list-sources

# Filter sources by dataset
python -m src.cli list-sources --dataset "publinks-2025-09"

# Show HTTP status tracking for specific source
python -m src.cli dump-http-status --source-uuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
```

### Data Versioning and Export

#### Dataset Version Management

```bash
# Create a new dataset version
python -m src.cli create-version --dataset candidate_links --tag v2025-09-21-1 --description "Updated source list"

# List all dataset versions
python -m src.cli list-versions

# List versions for specific dataset
python -m src.cli list-versions --dataset candidate_links

# Export a dataset version
python -m src.cli export-version --version-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc --output exports/candidate_links_v1.parquet
```

#### Snapshot Export

Create Parquet snapshots from database tables:

```bash
# Basic snapshot export
python -m src.cli export-snapshot \
  --version-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc \
  --table articles \
  --output artifacts/snapshots/articles_20250921.parquet

# Export with compression
python -m src.cli export-snapshot \
  --version-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc \
  --table candidate_links \
  --output artifacts/snapshots/sources_compressed.parquet \
  --snapshot-compression snappy

# Export with custom chunk size for large tables
python -m src.cli export-snapshot \
  --version-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc \
  --table articles \
  --output artifacts/snapshots/articles_large.parquet \
  --snapshot-chunksize 50000 \
  --snapshot-compression gzip
```

**Compression Options:** `snappy`, `gzip`, `brotli`, `zstd`, `none`

### ML Analysis

```bash
# Run ML analysis on extracted content
python -m src.cli analyze
```

### Common CLI Patterns

```bash
# Complete discovery and extraction workflow
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-limit 20 --max-articles 50
python -m src.cli extract --limit 100 --batches 3
python -m src.cli status

# Targeted source processing
python -m src.cli discover-urls --source-filter "columbia" --force-all
python -m src.cli extract --source "Columbia Missourian"

# Create and export versioned snapshot
python -m src.cli create-version --dataset articles --tag v2025-09-21-final
python -m src.cli export-snapshot --version-id <VERSION_ID> --table articles --output final_articles.parquet
```

**Note**: All commands support `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` for controlling output verbosity.

### Populate Gazetteer

Populate gazetteer table with geographic entities (schools, businesses, landmarks, etc.) near publisher locations using OpenStreetMap data. This is automatically triggered when loading new sources, but can also be run manually.

```bash
# Populate gazetteer for all datasets
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer

# Populate gazetteer for specific dataset
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --dataset "publinks-2025-09"

# Test with specific address
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --address "Columbia, MO" --radius 25

# Dry run (no database writes)
python -m src.cli populate-gazetteer --dry-run --address "Columbia, MO"
```

**Note**: Gazetteer population is automatically triggered in the background when new publisher/host records are loaded via `load-sources`. The process uses OpenStreetMap APIs and includes respectful rate limiting.

#### Batch Gazetteer Processing

For processing large numbers of sources, use the specialized backfill script with conservative rate limiting:

```bash
# Conservative batch processing with 5-8 second delays between sources
python scripts/backfill_gazetteer_slow.py

# Script features:
# - Rate limiting: 5-8 seconds between sources (respectful to OSM APIs)
# - Progress tracking: Shows completed vs total sources
# - Resume capability: Skips already-processed sources automatically
# - Comprehensive telemetry: Full JSON logging to gazetteer_telemetry.log
```

**Recommended for:**

- Initial population of large source datasets (100+ sources)

- Production environments where API rate limiting is critical

- Unattended batch processing with comprehensive monitoring

#### OSM Gazetteer Optimization

The gazetteer system has been optimized for efficiency and comprehensive coverage:

**Performance Optimization:**

- **API Call Reduction**: 67% fewer API calls (4 vs 12) through intelligent query grouping

- **Smart Grouping**: Logical category groups that maximize query efficiency while maintaining coverage

- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with appropriate delays between requests

**Comprehensive Geographic Coverage:**

- **11 Categories**: Schools, government, healthcare, businesses, landmarks, sports, transportation, religious, entertainment, economic, emergency

- **61 OSM Filters**: Complete filter set covering diverse geographic entities

- **3-Group Architecture**:

  - `civic_essential` (18 filters): schools, government, healthcare, emergency

  - `commercial_recreation` (25 filters): businesses, economic, entertainment, sports

  - `infrastructure_culture` (18 filters): transportation, landmarks, religious

**Technical Solutions:**

- **Fixed Historic Filter**: Replaced problematic `historic=*` wildcard with specific values (`historic=building`, `historic=monument`, `historic=memorial`, `historic=ruins`, `historic=archaeological_site`)

- **Element Distribution**: Intelligent categorization of OSM results back to specific categories

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling with individual query fallbacks for complex query failures

- **Debug Instrumentation**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and troubleshooting

**Validation Results** (Columbia, MO test):

- **3,070 elements** discovered within 20-mile radius

- **100% success rate** across all category groups

- **Excellent coverage** of schools (105), transportation (1,257), sports (686), and other categories

- **Production verified** in both single-address and database modes

### Export a Snapshot (table -> Parquet)

Create a Parquet snapshot by exporting a database table for a given
dataset version. This command is useful when you want to materialize a
consistent snapshot of a table (e.g., `articles` or `candidate_links`) and
store it as a Parquet file for analysis or archival.

Usage:

```bash
# Basic: export the `articles` table for an existing version to a file
python -m src.cli export-snapshot \
  --version-id <VERSION_UUID> \
  --table articles \
  --output artifacts/snapshots/articles_<VERSION_UUID>.parquet
```

Options:

- `--version-id` (required): the `id` of the `DatasetVersion` record to claim and finalize.

- `--table` (required): the database table name to export (e.g., `articles`).

- `--output` (required): destination Parquet file path.

- `--snapshot-chunksize` (optional): rows per chunk when streaming from the database (default: `10000`). Increase for fewer round-trips; decrease to lower memory usage.

- `--snapshot-compression` (optional): Parquet compression. Choose one of `snappy`, `gzip`, `brotli`, `zstd`, or `none`. The value `none` disables compression. Default is `None` (no compression).

Notes:

- If the project is running against Postgres and an advisory lock is available, the exporter will try to acquire a Postgres advisory lock and perform the export inside a `REPEATABLE READ` transaction to produce a consistent snapshot visible to that transaction.

- If `pyarrow` is installed the exporter will stream rows into a Parquet writer. Otherwise the exporter falls back to `pandas.DataFrame.to_parquet`.

- The exporter writes to a temporary file and atomically replaces the final path once the write completes (best-effort `fsync` to improve durability).

Example with compression:

```bash
python -m src.cli export-snapshot \
  --version-id 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef \
  --table articles \
  --output artifacts/snapshots/articles_0123.parquet \
  --snapshot-compression snappy
```

## Production Workflow

### Automated Pipeline (Argo Workflows)

In production, the pipeline runs automatically via Argo CronWorkflow (`mizzou-news-pipeline`) every 6 hours:

1. **Discovery Phase** (Argo Workflow)

   - Discovers article URLs from RSS feeds, sitemaps, and homepages

   - Stores discovered URLs in `candidate_links` table with status='pending'

   - Respects publication frequency and timing

1. **Verification Phase** (Argo Workflow)

   - Waits for minimum candidate links threshold

   - Validates URLs using StorySniffer

   - Updates status to 'article' for valid news articles

   - Filters out non-article pages (category pages, tag pages, etc.)

1. **Extraction Phase** (Argo Workflow)

   - Waits for minimum verified articles threshold

   - Fetches and extracts article content (title, body, author, date)

   - Stores in `articles` table with status='extracted'

   - Handles rate limiting and CAPTCHA backoff

1. **Cleaning Phase** (Continuous Processor)

   - Removes boilerplate content (navigation, sidebars, subscription prompts)

   - Cleans and normalizes author names

   - Updates status to 'cleaned'

1. **ML Analysis Phase** (Continuous Processor)

   - Applies Critical Information Needs (CIN) classification

   - Generates article summaries (optional)

   - Updates status to 'labeled'

1. **Entity Extraction Phase** (Continuous Processor)

   - Extracts geographic entities using gazetteer

   - Stores locations in `locations` table

   - Links entities to articles

1. **BigQuery Export**

   - Exports processed articles to BigQuery for analytics

   - Scheduled via Data Transfer Service

### Local Development Workflow

For local development and testing with SQLite:

1. **Load Sources:** CSV → Database (candidate_links table) + Auto-trigger gazetteer population

1. **Discover URLs:** `python -m src.cli discover-urls` - Smart discovery using publication frequency

1. **Extract Content:** `python -m src.cli extract` - Process discovered articles

1. **Clean Content:** Automatic via processor or `python -m src.cli content-cleaning`

1. **Analyze:** `python -m src.cli analyze` - ML classification

**Geographic Enhancement**: When new sources are loaded, the system automatically triggers gazetteer population in the background. This process geocodes publisher locations and discovers nearby geographic entities (schools, businesses, landmarks, etc.) using OpenStreetMap APIs.

## Database Migrations

The project uses Alembic for database schema migrations:

```bash
# Run pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Create a new migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# Rollback last migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

See [docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md](docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md) for detailed migration procedures.

## Content Cleaning Tools

The project includes specialized tools for analyzing and implementing content cleaning:

```bash
# Dry run content cleaning across all articles
python dry_run_content_cleaning.py

# Detailed content analysis for a specific domain
python detailed_content_analysis.py douglascountyherald.com

# Show persistent pattern analysis (ML training vs telemetry patterns)
python show_patterns.py www.douglascountyherald.com

# View cross-domain pattern summary
python show_patterns.py --summary

# Test ML training vs telemetry pattern separation
python test_ml_telemetry.py
```

These tools use the `BalancedBoundaryContentCleaner` and `ContentCleaningTelemetry` systems to identify and remove boilerplate content while maintaining comprehensive tracking for quality assurance and machine learning applications.

## Deployment

### Production Deployment (Kubernetes)

The system is deployed on GKE using Cloud Build triggers that automatically build and deploy container images.

**Container Images:**

- `processor`: Continuous processor for internal processing steps

- `api`: FastAPI backend for telemetry and admin operations

- `base`: Base image with common dependencies

- `ml-base`: Extended base with ML models and dependencies

- `migrator`: Database migration container with Alembic

**Deployment Process:**

1. Push code to GitHub (triggers Cloud Build)

1. Cloud Build builds container images

1. Images pushed to Artifact Registry

1. Kubernetes deployments updated with new images

1. Rolling update with zero downtime

**Key Kubernetes Resources:**

- `k8s/processor-deployment.yaml` - Continuous processor

- `k8s/api-deployment.yaml` - API service with LoadBalancer

- `k8s/argo/base-pipeline-workflow.yaml` - Argo workflow template

- `k8s/argo/mizzou-pipeline-cronworkflow.yaml` - Scheduled pipeline runs

See [docs/KUBERNETES_GUIDE.md](docs/KUBERNETES_GUIDE.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### Configuration and Secrets

**Database Configuration:**

- Connection via Cloud SQL Connector (embedded in Python application)

- No proxy sidecar required

- Credentials stored in Kubernetes Secret `cloudsql-db-credentials`

- Automatic connection pooling and SSL/TLS

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_ENGINE=postgresql+psycopg2
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Cloud SQL Connector local endpoint
DATABASE_PORT=5432
USE_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTOR=true
CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE=mizzou-news-crawler:us-central1:mizzou-db-prod

# Pipeline Step Feature Flags (Issue #77 refactoring)
ENABLE_DISCOVERY=false      # Moved to Argo workflows
ENABLE_VERIFICATION=false   # Moved to Argo workflows
ENABLE_EXTRACTION=false     # Moved to Argo workflows
ENABLE_CLEANING=true        # Continuous processor
ENABLE_ML_ANALYSIS=true     # Continuous processor
ENABLE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION=true  # Continuous processor

# Rate Limiting
CAPTCHA_BACKOFF_BASE=1800   # 30 minutes base backoff
CAPTCHA_BACKOFF_MAX=7200    # 2 hours max backoff
```

**Secrets Management:**

- GCP Secret Manager for sensitive credentials

- Kubernetes Secrets for database access

- Workload Identity for secure GCP service authentication

### Local Development

For local development, the system uses SQLite by default but can connect to PostgreSQL.

## Monitoring and Operations

### Current Status

**Operational Components:**

- ✅ API service with telemetry endpoints

- ✅ Continuous processor (cleaning, ML, entity extraction)

- ✅ Argo Workflows orchestration (6-hour schedule)

- ✅ Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with automated backups

- ✅ BigQuery export for analytics

**Known Gaps (Phase 8 - Observability):**

- ⚠️ Limited centralized monitoring (no Prometheus/Grafana)

- ⚠️ No automated alerting for pipeline failures

- ⚠️ Manual health checking required

- ⚠️ Network policies not configured

### Monitoring Pipeline Status

**Check Argo Workflows:**

```bash
# List workflow runs
kubectl get workflows -n production

# Check CronWorkflow schedule
kubectl get cronworkflow mizzou-news-pipeline -n production

# View workflow logs
kubectl logs -n production -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=<workflow-name>
```

**Check Processor Status:**

```bash
# Check processor pod status
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=mizzou-processor

# View processor logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --follow

# Check work queue status
kubectl logs -n production -l app=mizzou-processor --tail=200 | grep "Work queue status"
```

**Check API Health:**

```bash
# Get API service endpoint
kubectl get service mizzou-api -n production

# Test API endpoint
curl http://<API_IP>/api/telemetry/summary?days=7
```

### Known Issues and Limitations

**Current Limitations:**

- Frontend dashboard exists but deployment status unclear

- No automated site-specific credentials for authenticated crawling ([Issue #101](https://github.com/LocalNewsImpact/MizzouNewsCrawler/issues/101))

## Contributing & Development

### Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`

1. **Focused Changes**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix

1. **Tests Required**: Add tests for new functionality

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` before committing

1. **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns and pass linting checks

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and test
python -m pytest tests/

# Run linters
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Testing

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run local CI tests before pushing to catch failures early:**

```bash
# Quick commands (using Makefile)
make test-ci          # Full CI suite with coverage (matches GitHub Actions)
make test-unit        # Unit tests only (no database)
make test-integration # Integration tests with SQLite
make test-postgres    # PostgreSQL integration tests
make test-all-ci      # All suites sequentially

# Or use the unified pre-deploy validation script directly
# Examples (preferred):
# Run full CI-style validation (unit + sqlite integration + postgres integration in Docker):
./scripts/pre-deploy-validation.sh all --docker-ci

# Run unit-only (fast) locally (uses pytest marker filtering):
PYTEST_K="not integration and not postgres and not slow" ./scripts/pre-deploy-validation.sh all --sqlite-only

# Run integration tests with SQLite (fast, matches CI 'integration' job):
./scripts/pre-deploy-validation.sh all --sqlite-only

# Run PostgreSQL integration tests (Docker-based, matches CI 'postgres-integration' job):
./scripts/pre-deploy-validation.sh all --docker-ci --postgres-only

# Benefits:
# ✅ Matches exact CI environment (PostgreSQL, markers, coverage)
# ✅ Runs migrations automatically
# ✅ Catches CI failures before pushing
# ✅ Color-coded output
```

**Manual test commands (may differ from CI):**

```bash
# Run all tests (not recommended - may differ from CI)
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test module
python -m pytest tests/test_telemetry_system.py -v
```

**📚 Documentation:**

- [docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - **Complete testing guide** (markers, CI matching, debugging)
- [docs/TESTING_OPERATIONS_DASHBOARD.md](docs/TESTING_OPERATIONS_DASHBOARD.md) - Operations testing guidelines
- [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md) - **Production smoke tests** (E2E validation after deployment)

**Git Pre-Push Hook Installed:**
A git hook automatically runs tests before every push. Use `git push --no-verify` to skip (not recommended).

### Production Smoke Tests

After deploying to production, run end-to-end smoke tests to validate critical workflows:

```bash
# Run all production smoke tests
./scripts/run-production-smoke-tests.sh

# Run specific test class
./scripts/run-production-smoke-tests.sh TestSectionURLExtraction

# Run with verbose output
./scripts/run-production-smoke-tests.sh --verbose
```

These tests validate:
- ✅ Section URL extraction and discovery integration
- ✅ Complete discovery → verification → extraction pipeline
- ✅ Telemetry system and hash column handling
- ✅ ML pipeline (entity extraction, classification)
- ✅ Data integrity and performance

Tests run automatically via GitHub Actions after successful deployments. See [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md) for details.

### Code Quality Tools

**Markdown Linting:**

If you don't want to install Node-based tools, there's a small, dependency-free script that performs common markdown checks and safe fixes:

```bash
python tools/markdownlint_check.py          # show issues
python tools/markdownlint_check.py --apply  # apply safe fixes in-place
```

Alternatively, use the full Node-based `markdownlint` toolchain (requires `npm`):

```bash
npm install          # install dev dependencies
npm run lint:md      # run checks
npm run lint:md:fix  # run autofix (use with caution)
```

**Python Linting:**

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific checks
flake8 src/
mypy src/
```
