"""Calculate optimal extraction parallelism based on backlog size.

Scaling formula:
- Target: Complete backlog in 4 hours (240 minutes)
- Processing time: 4 minutes per article
- Articles per worker: 240 / 4 = 60 articles in 4 hours
- Workers needed: backlog / 60
- Minimum: 3 workers (always maintain baseline capacity)
- Maximum: 15 workers (cost/resource constraint)

Examples:
- 50 articles: 50/60 = 0.83 → 3 workers (minimum)
- 180 articles: 180/60 = 3 workers
- 600 articles: 600/60 = 10 workers
- 1200 articles: 1200/60 = 20 → 15 workers (maximum)
