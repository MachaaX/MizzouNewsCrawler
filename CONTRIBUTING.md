1. Development setup

1. Python >= 3.11 is required.
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

1. Run linters and formatters before submitting a PR:

```bash
# format
black .
# lint
ruff .
# run mypy
mypy src
```

1. Running tests

1. Unit tests:

```bash
pytest -m "not integration" -q
```

1. Integration tests (PostgreSQL):

```bash
# Requires TEST_DATABASE_URL env var pointing to a test Postgres instance
pytest -m integration -q
```

1. To run the full test suite (slow):

```bash
pytest -q
```

1. Branches, commits and PRs

1. Create feature branches off `main` using descriptive names:
   `fix/issue-123-short-desc` or `feat/new-discovery-source`.
1. Keep commits small and focused. Squash WIP commits before merge.
1. Write clear commit messages. The project uses conventional-style messages,
   e.g., `fix(...)`, `feat(...)`, `docs(...)`, `test(...)`.
1. Open a Pull Request against `main`. Include:
   - What the PR changes
   - Why it’s needed
   - How to test it locally

1. Review process

1. At least one approving review is required for non-trivial changes.
1. CI must be green (unit, integration, mypy, lint/format) before merge.

1. Testing guidelines

1. Add unit tests for new logic paths and regressions for bug fixes.
1. Integration tests that require PostgreSQL should be marked with
   `@pytest.mark.integration` and documented in `tests/integration/README.md`.

1. Code style

1. Follow the existing style: Black + Ruff + isort. The repository has
   pre-commit hooks configured; please use them.

1. Security & sensitive data

1. Never commit secrets (API keys, credentials). Use environment variables
   and secrets management for CI/production.
1. For proxy credentials (Squid and other providers), use one of these methods:
    - **Local development**: Set `SQUID_PROXY_URL`, `SQUID_PROXY_USERNAME`, and `SQUID_PROXY_PASSWORD` environment variables (username/password optional if your Squid tier is IP-allowlisted).
    - **Production**: Store the proxy credentials in GCP Secret Manager (referenced by the `squid-proxy-credentials` Kubernetes secret) and surface them as environment variables in deployments/jobs.
       Recommended payload: `{"url":"https://proxy.example.net:3128","username":"...","password":"..."}`.
1. If you find a security vulnerability, follow SECURITY.md to report it.
