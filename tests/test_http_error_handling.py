Test HTTP error handling in content extraction.

Tests for commits:
- 615f8f9: Exception handling for 404/410 in extract_content()
- c59124a: Comprehensive HTTP error code coverage (all 4xx/5xx)

These tests ensure that HTTP error responses properly stop fallback
extraction attempts and raise appropriate exceptions.
