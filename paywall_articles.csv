Also, be sure to be at the square to catch the 60th annual Ozark Chamber Christmas Parade on Saturday, Nov. 22, and Friday Night Lights on Friday, Dec. 12.

Born in rural Arkansas, he moved to Southwest Missouri at age three and became a life-long resident of Northern Stone and Christian Counties. Gary was a man of many talents, careers, and connections. If you needed something, he probably had it to sell to you; if you needed something done, he had a guy. If you lived in Christian, Stone, or Barry Counties, chances are you had met Gary at least once. He did everything from probate auctions to owning car washes and convenience stores to real estate. But his real passion was livestock markets. He was an avid coon hunter in his younger years and became a solid fisherman in retirement.

Not long afterwards, Dr. Chris Rispoli, co-owner of the Gentle Care Animal Hospital in Edmond, Okla., made a social media post disparaging Kirk and suggesting that other people like him would also be killed. Several people reacted angrily to Rispoli’s post. However, some of those responding to Rispoli directed their anger at the Gentle Care Animal Hospital in Nixa, a veterinary clinic that has the same name as Rispoli’s but is not affiliated with them.

Dear editor,

As we approach Thanksgiving Day on November 27, let us remember that first Thanksgiving Day when the Pilgrims and Indians came together to enjoy a great Thanksgiving feast. The winter before had been so hard on the pilgrims, with many of them not even surviving. Even so, with a plentiful harvest that year, the survivors were rejoicing with the Indians and thanking God for their blessings.

As we enjoy our Thanksgiving dinner with family and friends, let us remember to thank God for our many blessings. Most of all, let us be thankful for Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who left His home in heaven to come to earth to live among His creation. Jesus loves us so much that He was willing to become the sacrifice on the cross of Calvary so that His blood could cover our sins. When we give our lives to Jesus in obedience to His will, our sins will be forgiven and we will have the promise of living in heaven with Him for all of eternity. There is no greater gift. Thank you Jesus.

JM Stock

In years past, I’ve written here about how grateful I am for the family, friends and colleagues who play such a huge role in my life. I’ve noted how blessed we have been to work in agriculture despite the ups and downs. I’ve shared how excited I am about the weeks to come with our Missouri Farm Bureau annual meeting and the holiday season that comes with the turn of the calendar.

Now, I know some things are meant to be loud: rock concerts, demolition, crying babies, football games. I enjoy that kind of loud. A place for everything and everything in its place, right?

The Liberty Christian girls basketball team needed a win in the worst way on Tuesday.

Coming off back-to-back losses, Liberty faced an Eagle Ridge Christian team from Cape Girardeau and managed to right the ship in the 43-34 home win.

Freshman guard Bristol Barron, who led the Eagles (3-2) in scoring with 15 points, praised the team for jumping to leads of 16-4 after the first quarter and 21-12 by halftime.

“This feels really good, I knew we had it in us,” Barron said. “We had to keep putting that hustle and that drive in.”

Liberty coach Kim Meyer said that the team was able to wear down the opposition by using a pair of groups that shifted in and out of the game at regular intervals to keep the team fresh.

“I thought they worked really well together tonight,” Meyer said. “We’re still learning as a team and growing. The girls are developing a good unity. They’re doing very well, encouraging one another.”

After Barron, junior Mallory Boenker added seven points and senior Trina Scheltens pitched in five.

Having returned to winning ways, Liberty will now head to Calvary Lutheran in Jefferson City for a game on Monday. The opening tip is scheduled for 6 p.m."

Officials with the Wright City Fire Protection District said the cause of a fire that started in a garage of a home on Beretta Court is still under investigation.

A fire Saturday at a home on Beretta Court in Wright City was contained and crews were able to save 50 percent of the home according to an official with the Wright City Fire Protection District.

Assistant Chief Josh Riebe said the call of a fire in a garage in a home on Beretta Court came in around 4:25 p.m. Saturday afternoon. Riebe said that when firefighters arrived on scene there was fire clearly visible on the roof above the garage. He said everyone was able to exit the home safely, including the family dog.

Riebe said crews worked to contain the fire and were able to stop the fire from getting into the portion of the home where the bedrooms are located.

In addition to Wright City fire personnel, Riebe said his department was assisted by the Warrenton Fire Protection District and Wentzville Fire Protection District. Riebe said the Wright City Police Department also assisted with traffic management on Wildcat Drive and the Warren County Ambulance District was on standby."

Trained noses on call

When disasters occur across Missouri or within the United States, Missouri Task Force 1 (MOTF-1) is trained and ready to respond. It is one of 28 urban search and rescue teams in the nation and is managed by Boone County Fire Protection District in Columbia. A unique team from Marthasville is on rotation to respond, but instead of using the typical rescue skills, two of its members use their highly sophisticated noses. Glenda Eichmeyer and two of her dogs, Athena, and Lily, are certified members of MOTF-1."

Fayette High School has a bright new digital sign at its entrance along Highway 5. Commercial Trust Company of Fayette donated $50,000 to help the district replace the old sign. Alexander and Associates installed the new sign on October 2.

“It’s an honor for Commercial Trust to partner with the Fayette R-III Schools in many ways over the years,” said Commercial Trust Co. President Janet Jacobs, herself a Fayette High School graduate. “The school is the heart of our community, and Commercial Trust is proud to show our Falcon pride with the sponsorship of this new sign. We hope everyone who drives by will take pride in our schools and the students, teachers, staff, administration, and parents who all represent Fayette in a positive way throughout our area.”

The new sign features a large digital display that shows the date and time, weather information, positive student messages, a weekly events schedule, and employment opportunities.

The old sign was installed in August 2007 at the request of then Commercial Trust President Jay Jacobs, who, along with his wife, Kelly, donated $500,000 to the school in April of that year."

A 41-year-old New Franklin man was killed late Friday night in a single-vehicle crash on Route P north of County Road 451 in Howard County.

According to a Missouri State Highway Patrol crash report, the accident occurred at approximately 10 p.m. on Friday, September 12. The patrol reports that a 2005 Arctic Cat ATV traveled off the right side of the roadway, overturned, and ejected the driver.

The driver, whose name had not been released at press time, was pronounced dead at the scene by Howard County Coroner Trisha Clark at 7:50 a.m. on September 13.

The ATV sustained minor damage and was towed from the scene. The driver was not wearing a safety device, according to the patrol.

This crash marks Troop F’s first fatality for September and the 29th fatality of 2025, according to the Highway Patrol."
